  abstract = {Thin active elements can be added to rigid surfaces for the tuning of mechanical contact properties. The deformation of the active structures leads to the forming of arches. Depending on the forming of the arch, the force--displacement curve for contact becomes more or less steep. This can be understood as changing the interaction property between soft and hard. Herein, this concept is presented with hydrogels inside the active elements. Analytical derivations and finite-element simulation results for actuation and contact, based on the stimulus expansion model, are shown. This modeling approach appropriately captures the stimulus-dependent swelling properties of the material and can be easily applied in commercial finite-element tools. Special considerations are taken for the encapsulation of the active materials. A thin encapsulation foil allows 1) the use of swelling agents, such as water, without contaminating the contact objects. Furthermore, 2) appropriate water reservoirs for the swelling process can be included. The simulation results show that a surface softness tuning can be realized. The presented active material and dimensions are exemplary; the concept can be applied to other active materials for tuning surface interactions.},

Herein, we evaluate the functionality of thermoresponsive double network (DN) hydrogel membranes based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and an electrostatic co-monomer, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS). DN hydrogels are comprised of a tightly crosslinked, ionized first network [P(NIPAAm-co-AMPS)] containing variable levels of AMPS (100:0--25:75 wt\% ratio of NIPAAm:AMPS) and a loosely crosslinked, interpenetrating second network [PNIPAAm]. To meet the specific requirements of a subcutaneously implanted glucose biosensor, the volume phase transition temperature is tuned and essential properties, such as glucose diffusion kinetics, thermosensitivity, and cytocompatibility are evaluated. In addition, the self-cleaning functionality is demonstrated through thermally driven cell detachment from the membranes in vitro.},

  abstract  = {In this study, N-tert-butylmaleimic acid was designed for the first
	time and synthesized by reaction of maleic anhydride with tert-butylamine
	and evaluated as a new functional monomer for preparation of new
	pH-responsive hydrogels. Its structure was verified with FTIR, 1H
	and 13C NMR. A new pH- and temperature-responsive hydrogel p(TBMAC-co-NIPAM),
	based on TBMAC and NIPAM, was successfully prepared via free-radical
	copolymerization technique in an aqueous solution. The chemical and
	structural properties of the hydrogels were identified by FTIR and
	SEM. The swelling properties of these hydrogels were systematically
	investigated according to various parameters such as time, temperature,
	pH and salt effects, and the results show that they are strongly
	influenced by the content of TBMAC and exhibit strong pH, temperature
	and salinity sensitivity. In addition, swelling kinetics and water
	diffusion mechanisms in hydrogels were discussed. In addition, in
	vitro drug release studies were performed in simulated gastric, isotonic
	serum and intestinal fluid at two different temperatures (23 and
	37 {$^{\circ}$}C) by taking R6G as a model drug. Drug loading results were investigated
	with various isotherm models such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin
	and Dubinin-Radushkevich. Various kinetic models such as zero-order,
	first-order, Higuchi model and Korsmeyer-Peppas models were applied
	to determine the drug release mechanism. The results indicated that
	drug release involves non-Fickian transport mechanism. These results
	suggest that this new pH- and thermo-responsive hydrogel may be used
	to improve sustained release of drugs.},

Control of solar transmission through windows promises to reduce building energy consumption. However, the ability of current chromogenic technologies to regulate solar gain with the tunable extinction of phase-change materials is still far from optimum. We report a strategy for optimizing the transmittance modulation range of temperature-responsive hydrogel particles by means of tuning the light-scattering behaviors through controlling particle size and internal structure. An emerging thermochromic material, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-2-aminoethylmethacrylate hydrochloride (pNIPAm-AEMA) microparticles, was synthesized to demonstrate this strategy. The average size of pNIPAm-AEMA microparticles varies from 1,388{~}nm at 25{$^{\circ}$}C to 546{~}nm at 35{$^{\circ}$}C, contributing to an unprecedented infrared transmittance modulation of 75.6%. A high luminous transmittance of 87.2% at 25{$^{\circ}$}C had also been accomplished. An investigation of the tunable scattering behaviors of pNIPAm-AEMA particles provided mechanistic insight into light management by this class of materials, the application field of which is beyond energy-saving smart windows.},

This manuscript introduces a toolkit to rapidly prototype, manufacture, test, and power various designs of hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators with muscle-like performance that achieve all three basic modes of actuation (expansion, contraction, and rotation). This toolkit utilizes easy-to-implement methods, inexpensive fabrication tools, commodity materials, and off-the-shelf high-voltage electronics thereby enabling a wide audience to explore HASEL technology. Remarkably, the actuators created from this easy-to-implement toolkit achieve linear strains exceeding 100\%, a specific power greater than 150 W kg$-$1, and $\approx$20\% strain at frequencies above 100 Hz. This combination of large strain, extreme speed, and high specific power yields soft actuators that jump without power-amplifying mechanisms. Additionally, an efficient fabrication technique is introduced for modular designs of HASEL actuators, which is used to develop soft robotic devices driven by portable electronics. Inspired by the versatility of elephant trunks, the above capabilities are combined to create an untethered continuum robot for grasping and manipulating delicate objects, highlighting the wide potential of the introduced methods for soft robots with increasing sophistication.},

  abstract = {Abstract As a common smart hydrogel, thermo-sensitive hydrogel exhibits significant potential applications in the field of biological engineering due to its unique property of undergoing a substantial volume transition in response to temperature changes. For numerical implementation of thermo-sensitive hydrogel, many approaches have been developed to simulate the transient deformation during fluid diffusion or heat conduction process. However, the numerical approach for the transient deformation during both fluid diffusion and heat conduction processes is still lacking. To this end, we develop a three-field coupled finite element framework that can be used to simulate the transient deformation behavior of thermo-sensitive hydrogel involving large deformation, fluid diffusion, and heat conduction. In the proposed framework, there exist three processes that deal with displacement, concentration, and temperature fields, separately. To realize the coupling of three fields, the separated solving processes are assembled together by using a two-way coupled approach. Based on the developed finite element framework, the coupling effects between the concentration and temperature can be realized by defining a body flux and a temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient without solving the complex coupling equations. The finite element framework is implemented in ABAQUS by utilizing several user subroutines. The numerical implementation is validated by comparing the numerical results of a hydrogel disk with experimental results. Furthermore, various numerical examples are simulated to investigate the applicability of the proposed finite element framework under different multi-field coupling conditions. The proposed finite element scheme is proved to be an efficient and stable tool for numerically simulating the transient behavior of thermo-sensitive hydrogel incorporating the phase transition effect.},

  abstract = {Abstract Soft pneumatic actuators and motor-based mechanisms being concomitant with the cumbersome appendages have many challenges to making the independent robotic system with compact and lightweight configuration. Meanwhile, shape memory actuators have shown a promising alternative solution in many engineering applications ranging from artificial muscle to aerospace industry. However, one of the main limitations of such systems is their inherent softness resulting in a small actuation force, which prevents them from more effective applications. This issue can be solved by combining shape memory actuators and the mechanism of stiffness modulation. As a first, this study describes a shape memory alloy-based soft gripper composed of three identical fingers with variable stiffness for adaptive grasping in low stiffness state and effective holding in high stiffness state. Each finger with two hinges is fabricated through integrating soft composite actuator with stiffness changeable material where each hinge can approximately achieve a 55-fold changeable stiffness independently. Besides, each finger with two hinges can actively achieve multiple postures by both selectively changing the stiffness of hinges and actuating the relevant SMA wire. Based on these principles, the gripper is applicable for grasping objects with deformable shapes and varying shapes with a large range of weight where its maximum grasping force is increased to $\sim$10 times through integrating with the stiffness changeable mechanism. The final demonstration shows that the finger with desired shape-retained configurations enables the gripper to successfully pick up a frustum-shaped object.},

  abstract = {The stress created by the austenite transformation of mechanically constrained NiTi shape memory alloys (SMAs) significantly exceeds that required to deform (detwin) its low temperature martensitic phase. The one-way shape memory effect can therefore be used to create antagonistic, fully reversible flexural shape morphing structures by assembling opposing pairs of linear contractile SMA actuators. These structures possess two distinct inactive configurations, neither of which requires continuous power for shape retention making them potentially suitable for long-term applications. Here, the shape changes of a representative antagonistic flexural unit cell have been experimentally evaluated, and the effect of the pre-strain of near equiatomic NiTi alloys on the actuation strain has been analyzed and discussed. The predicted deformations are then successfully compared to the response of prototype actuators.},

  abstract = {Hydrogels are hydrophilic, highly water swellable polymer networks capable of converting chemical energy into mechanical energy and vice versa. They can be tailored regarding their chemical nature and physical structure, sensitiveness to external stimuli and biocompatibility; they can be formed in various structures and integrated into (micro-)systems. Accordingly, over the last decade, these materials have gained considerable recognition as valuable tool for sensors and in diagnostics. This article reviews the use of hydrogels in sensor development with focus on recent efforts in the application of stimuli responsive hydrogels as sensors, hydrogels as suitable matrices in which the sensing (bio-)molecules are embedded and hydrogels for modification and protection of sensor surfaces. In the first part of the review, both sensors and hydrogels are defined and a basic theoretical overview of hydrogels and their behavior is given. Subsequent chapters focus on hydrogels in physicochemical and biochemical sensing mechanisms with a primary emphasis on the hydrogels as such and the applied sensing mechanism. Finally, the review is concluded by a summary and discussion including an outlook on future perspectives for hydrogels in sensing applications.},

  abstract  = {Ionomeric polymer transducers exhibit electromechanical coupling capabilities.
	The ion transport due to electric stimulus is the primary mechanism
	of actuation for a class of polymeric active materials known as ionomeric
	polymer transducers. In this article, a two-dimensional Monte Carlo
	simulation of ion hopping has been developed to describe ion transport
	in materials that have fixed and mobile charge similar to the structure
	of the ionic polymer transducer. Such Monte Carlo simulations were
	performed to study the influence of conducting powder electrodes
	on stationary ion distribution in actuation. Ion accumulation around
	the powder sphere at the cathode is clearly observed in simulation
	results. Moreover, based on the unique property of stationary charge
	density of ionomeric polymer transducers in actuation, this article
	proposed a novel multi-scale model connecting Monte Carlo simulation
	for the material boundaries and a continuum model for the central
	part. To validate this multi-scale model, the simulation results
	are compared with experimental measurements. Both transient and steady-state
	responses from the experiments show reasonable agreement with those
	from the multi-scale model.},
