# SHAPES_Tables
## A living document with a collection of sources for active materials and concepts of Soft-Hard Active-Passive Embedded Structures (SHAPES)

This is a repository that includes the current state of the art in Soft-Hard Active-Passive Embedded Structures (SHAPES).
SHAPES are systems that include active materials, i.e., materials that respond to a stimulus with an actuation. All details and the original version of this table is given in our research work [1].
The shapes_tables.pdf document is generated with the given shapes_tables.tex file, based on the shapes_tables.bib bibliography. It includes two tables: Table 1 shows active materials that can be included in SHAPES setups. Table 2 gives an overview over different types of applications, where the strengths of these systems can be used to great advantage.
We created this repository of tables as a curated and trustworthy source of citations. We encourage all scientists and engineers from our field to expand this table horizontally and vertically. We will review the suggestions and add every contributor to the contributor list (see below). Thank you for your contribution!

## How to contribute:
If you are working in the field of active materials or active-passive structures, sensorics, (soft) robotics, embedded sensorics, MEMS, morphing aerospace structures, materials for biotechnology, or any other adjacent field, in which SHAPES-like systems are used, we are very happy for your contribution! This can be your own scientific work(s), but also new and exciting works of other authors that you found in your research.
You can add (i) new literature sources, (ii) new active material classes to Table 1, or (iii) new application cases to Table 2. Furthermore, you can (iv) challenge entries.

(i) If you want to add new sources, please add them to the Bibtex file named as AuthorYEAR(a, b,...). Furthermore, please add at least 1 sentence about why this paper is part of your proposed category (column, row) in the submission message.
Please note that we only want to add peer-reviewed research works to ensure the high quality of the reference list. We also prefer high quality journals and will double-check sources from journals that seem low quality (like predatory open access "pay to publish" journals). Furthermore, we need access to the manuscripts to check if the presented application or material really fulfills the criteria of the classification. We therefore either need access to the paper or the paper must be open access published. Also, try to avoid any duplicates of the same SHAPES system (e.g., adding two papers about the same system). We only want to accept thoroughly researched additions, so please do not suggest to add large lists of "AI-researched" sources.

(ii) If you want to add new active materials, please make sure to provide an adequate description of the material class in the same way as it is given in source [1]. Please also make sure that the material class is not a sub-class of an already-mentioned class. Then, add a new row to Table 1, which is supported by at least 2 literature sources that show the stimulus-responsiveness of the material. For adding new sources, please refer to (i).

(iii) For adding new application cases, please proceed in the same way as mentioned in (ii). Here, please make sure that your new secondary concept is really a standalone concept and cannot be subsumed to an already-defined class. Please refer to [1] for an in-depth discussion of the secondary concepts.

(iv) To challenge an entry, please file an issue. Only challenge 1 entry with each issue. Therein, please thoroughly describe why you do not agree with this classification. We will then discuss and act accordingly. Please, do not suggest any removals in the list by a pull request.

If you want to suggest changes to the tables, please also provide your name and affiliation for the addition in the list of contributors. If instead you want to stay anonymous, please don't hesitate to contact me for the addition of the sources via email.

We will thoroughly review your suggestions and come back to you with a first response within two weeks. However, this time can also vary depending on the number of monthly additions.
